# 🍽️ Restaurant Tips Analysis  

This project explores the **Restaurant Tips Dataset** to analyze tipping patterns based on different factors such as gender, smoking habits, time of the day, day of the week, and party size.  

The analysis is done using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)** in a Jupyter Notebook.  

---

## 📊 Project Objectives  
- Understand customer tipping behavior in restaurants.  
- Analyze correlations between **bill amount, tip amount, and other factors**.  
- Visualize key insights using graphs and charts.  
- Practice **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization** with Python.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains the following columns:  
- `total_bill` → Total bill amount.  
- `tip` → Tip amount given.  
- `sex` → Gender of the customer.  
- `smoker` → Whether the customer is a smoker.  
- `day` → Day of the week.  
- `time` → Lunch or Dinner.  
- `size` → Size of the dining party.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** → Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization  

---

## 📌 Key Insights  
- Tips generally increase with higher total bills.  
- Larger groups tend to give slightly bigger tips, but percentage-wise tips may be lower.  
- Dinner bills usually have higher tips than lunch.  
- Gender and smoking status show small variations in tipping behavior.  

---

## 📷 Sample Visualizations  
- Distribution of total bills and tips.  
- Scatter plot of **Total Bill vs Tip**.  
- Box plots of tips by **Gender, Day, and Time**.  
- Correlation heatmap.
